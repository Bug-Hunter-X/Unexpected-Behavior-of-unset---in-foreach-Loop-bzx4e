This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in PHP related to the unexpected behavior of the `unset()` function within a `foreach` loop when iterating over an array.  The `bug.php` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` shows a corrected version. The issue arises because `unset()` modifies the array's internal structure during iteration, potentially skipping elements or causing unexpected index changes.  The solution involves using a different approach to remove elements from the array to avoid this issue.
